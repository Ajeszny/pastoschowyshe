##Ideas:

- Database integration(save already read stories for offline use) DONE
- Transition animations for pages DONE
- Tap animation for main page DONE 
- Superuser mode in settings(can be later turned off for production)
- Hovering icon allowing to search, select at random or add(if superuser) stories
- Search by tags
- Backend stuff(text analysis and Telegram channel integration)(much much later)
